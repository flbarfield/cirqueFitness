<h2>Optimizations</h2>
As this is a currently developing project, there's a quite a lot of things I would like to implement! 

 1. Link up the date input with actual dates so that the user can look at past days for reference.
 2. Expand the exercise bank with more workouts. 
 3. Create a separate exercise bank that's purely community-driven. They'll be able to add and "like" the best exercises, so the ones with the best descriptions and videos will naturally rise to the top.
 4. Make a way for any particular exercise to be presented to the user as a graph based on past reps, sets, and weight increases so that they can see all the progress they've been making.
 5. Make fitnessapp page mobile responsive.
 6. Make an add-to-list button on result bank details, so that the user doesn't have to input all the data into a new exercise.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
This project is one that's actively allowed me to hone so many types of skills in one cohesive place as a full-stack web application. I've learned SO much from building, breaking, troubleshooting, cursing for hours, reviving the project and celebrating, only to break it again in a couple more days, and it's been such a wild ride! It's included the learning and usage of Passport, Node, Heroku, MongoDB, Express, EJS, Babel, and MVC architecture, all on top of dealing with strange problems within my JavaScript, CSS, and HTML foundations.
